# Smart Calculator
Calculators are a very helpful tool that we all use on a regular basis. Why not create one yourself, and make it really special? In this project, you will write a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember your previous calculations.

 This project is a part of the Java Developer track of [JetBrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/)
